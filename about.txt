we will create a project that will check the user's location based on browsers 
with the help of geolocation Api 
the documentations are in url:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API

we will use window.navigator.geolocation. and inside it 
we use Geolocation.getCurrentPosition();
